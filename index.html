      <h1>Nutrition & Coaching</h1>
      <h2>👋 Hi, I'm Vaughn Heart 😃</h2>
      <p>I believe in coaching that simplifies, not complicates. My work blends movement, nutrition, and behavioral awareness to help people build systems that fit their lives.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My approach is rooted in evidence and inclusivity. I'll help you build practical habits for long-term change. I believe by understanding how habits form, how environments shape behavior, and how small, sustainable changes lead to real transformation, we can become more mindful about how we approach our health, and by extension, our lives.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Whether it’s improving your relationship with food, building strength, or designing a lifestyle that supports your energy and focus, I focus on clarity and sustainability over extremes.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My background draws from public health, fitness instruction, and habit design. My goal is to translate the science of health into systems that feel human, flexible, and effective.</p>
