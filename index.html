<h1>Project Management & Systems</h1>

<p>I’m a builder of functional systems. I help entrepreneurs think clearer and move faster so they can focus on high-leverage work that moves their business forward.</p>

<p>My background blends project management from global MNCs with operational strategy for SMEs. I specialize in turning complexity into structure — building clear workflows, smarter automations, and aligned communication systems that make growth sustainable.</p>

<p>Often called a “Swiss Army Knife,” I’m comfortable working across time zones and tool stacks. From launching new processes to building dashboards or designing operational systems, I thrive in making things work better — and making them make sense.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I coach fitness classes, write, and spend time birdwatching. I live in the intersection where efficiency meets intentionality, prioritizing mindfulness above all.</p>
