      <h1>Nutrition & Coaching</h1>
      <h2>üëã Hi, I'm Vaughn Heart üòÉ</h2>
      <p>I believe in coaching that simplifies, not complicates. My work blends movement, nutrition, and behavioral awareness to help people build systems that fit their real lives ‚Äî not the other way around.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My approach is rooted in practical, long-term change. I help clients build consistency through mindful structure ‚Äî understanding how habits form, how environments shape behavior, and how small, sustainable changes lead to real transformation.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Whether it‚Äôs improving your relationship with food, building strength, or designing a lifestyle that supports your energy and focus, I focus on clarity and sustainability over extremes.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My background draws from public health, fitness instruction, and habit design ‚Äî translating the science of health into systems that feel human, flexible, and effective.</p>
